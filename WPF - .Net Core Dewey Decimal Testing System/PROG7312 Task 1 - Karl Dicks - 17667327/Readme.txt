Project Title: Dewey Training

Welcome to Dewey Training. This new desktop application has been developed for librarians and other users to learn the Dewey Decimal ordering system.
The aim of this application is to get librarians and other users of the system to order and manage books efficiently at libraries.
This would improve efficiency, and accuracy of these users, when they replace books on the numerous shelves in a library.
This application promotes the use of it, and by extension the learning of the Dewey Decimal system, by implementing gamification techniques, such as leaderboards, challenges, feedback, rewards, and progress.
By tracking and displaying this information, the user is more included to see the training software as a game, and therefore compete with one another.
In addition to this, the database will eventually be deployed to an online hosting platform (e.g. Azure SQL database), so that users on different devices may be able to compete with one another – they will be able to see one single leaderboard across multiple devices.

Getting Started
The following steps are required to get the Dewey Training software running on the development environment:
1. Open the application source code in Visual Studio
2. Set the start-up project to “Dewey Training”
3. Run the application on any Windows PC
